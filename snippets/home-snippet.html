        We have projects in Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The African drylands have reached a tipping point: Populations are rising, the climate is changing and inappropriate expansion of mechanised farming and oil exploration is threatening the lives of rural people and pushing them deeper into poverty.

        We look for innovative ways in which dryland people can challenge their marginalisation and discrimination. We also support African organisations that help farmers and herders gain security over key natural resources.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Sudan, our focus is regional rather than country-specific.</p>

        SOS Sahel UK believes that Sahelian poverty has its roots in the historical neglect of dryland areas, and particularly in discrimination against pastoralists (livestock herders) and nomadic groups.We argue that herding animals over rangeland is one of the most viable and productive use of drylands, which should be supported and encouraged. With natural resources becoming increasingly variable due to climate change, the case for supporting such an adaptive and ecologically sound livelihood system is overwhelming.</p>
        <p>We want to see the people of the Sahel influence the policy decisions that affect them and have control over the natural and economic resources they need for a secure and fulfilling life.</p>
        <p>Our work focuses on five main areas</p>
        <ul><li>Promoting sustainable natural resource management</li>
        <li>Promoting diversified livelihoods</li>
        <li>Strengtheing food security</li>

        <p>As a small, specialist organisation, SOS Sahel UK's main strengths are its flexibility and willingness to innovate and its firm belief in the capacity of dryland farmers and pastoralists to manage their environment with wisdom and skill.</p>
